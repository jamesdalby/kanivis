Knowles Audible Navigation for Visually Impaired Sailors

This program is designed to run on a smart phone, connect to a boat's NMEA0183 navigation data bus,
and then to aid a blind or visually impaired sailor by
- reading aloud various data concerning the boats situation
- providing parking-sensor style off-course (wind or compass) tones to enable the VI sailor to helm
- providing depth change indications

It is designed to be wholly accessible to the visually impaired, requiring only minimal
initial involvement of a sighted person to define the connection point (hostname or IP address, and
port number) of the boat's NME0183 feed. Thereafter the operation of the application is carefully
designed to be accessible to the visually impaired of blind sailor.

Detailed written instructions are available in the file DOC.md in this directory, which is
structured in such a way that it can be read aloud by any modern text-to-speech system.

This code is released under the GPLv2 in the hope that others will adopt and enhance it for the
benefit of the visually impaired sailing community. Should you wish to participate in the
development effort, or indeed have any suggestions for change or improvement, you are invited
to contact the author(s) through the github site or at
